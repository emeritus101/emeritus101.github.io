# Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of the project: 
This is an animation of the Boston MTA Real-Time Tracking System displaying stations betweeen MIT and Harvard.

## How to Run: 
On cliking the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button, the map will display the itinerary of the bus with all stops between the 2 universities.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
This is version 1.0. I would like to include in the near future a Search functionality and a Web Accessibility functionality.

## License information: 
The most of the program is coded and distributed according to MIT license. 
Please include MIT and Mapbox if using this part of code for your development.
